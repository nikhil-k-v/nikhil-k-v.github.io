            <p>The display refreshes at an <strong>average range of 100-200 wpm</strong>, and has a <strong>final build cost of around 10$</strong>. </p>

        <h1>THE PROBLEM</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="p-container">
        <p>After being shown the current, expensive solutions to internet-braille interfaces by a friend, I haven’t been able to stop imagining better 
        solutions. Through a two year journey of stumbling across various ideas in mechanisms, software, and use-cases, (<- here a bunch of links, in a separate 
        block maybe with arrows/lines pointing/connecting to them) I have finally prototyped a refreshable braille display that is extremely cheap, fast, and 
        dependable. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="img-container">
        <figcaption class="dark">THE CURRENT SOLUTIONS TO THE TECHNOLOGY X BRAILLE PROBLEM...</figcaption>  
        <img class="image" src="../assets/BrailleCurrent.PNG" alt="pictures of the current refreshable displays (screenshot of the website pages - with the price tags on them)" draggable="false" loop>
    </div>

    <div class="p-container">
        <p>Current refreshable braille displays use arrays of individual cells of braille, each dot having its own (apparently failure-prone) actuator - 
        displays with 40 characters often have 320 actuators, a nightmare in many ways, especially maintenance. One single actuator failing could produce gibberish 
        and render the entire display unusable. On top of that, the cost is often in the 4 figures, and in decades past that 4 would easily become 5, even 6 - not 
        including maintenance.

    </div>

    <div class="p-container">
        <p>The solution involves only 2 actuators for the braille, and a couple more for other functionality. By moving a refreshing cell of braille under your 
        finger at a speed controlled through the pot/joystick, you can simulate reading braille manually off of paper, where you can choose your current speed 
        and easily go backwards and forwards in the text. This prototype is functional - it can take any text and display the braille at a refreshing rate of 
        anywhere from 0 to 200 wpm, backwards and forwards.

    <div class="p-container">
        <p>Each servo is attached to a circle sector with 16 braille dots on its circumference - or rather 16 SPACES for braille dots. Some are “off” (0), while 
        some are “on” (1), and the overall sequence is 000011110110101 - the De Brujin Sequence for (2,4), something which you may be familiar with if you are 
        interested in algorithms, computer science, or even biology. The two sequences work together to produce any 4x2 braille cell, and then other motors in 
        the case move the entire subassembly past your finger (at a user controlled, variable speed) to simulate the feeling of running your finger across a page 
        of cells manually.

        <p>This project can be improved in many ways, and I encourage you to reach out to me if you have any ideas! It is still very early in its development, 
        and many of the issues you may see on the current prototype are already being worked on. For the time-being, this is what I am working on:
        <h4>Future Goals:</h4>
            <li>Smaller form factor</li>
            <li>Embedded Keyboard</li>
            <li>Silent - using quieter motors and fixing sources of friction</li>
            <li>Seamless interfacing with smartphone “voice readers” - all speech will be converted to braille automatically</li>
